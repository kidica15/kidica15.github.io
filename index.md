### CPSC 120
* Lab 5 Part 2:
I really enjoyed lab 8 part 2 as I was able to implement if statements, convert the max and min limits, and was able to calculate the integer part into an actual measurement of unit. The Todos were very helpful as my partner and I did not need that much help from the TAs in order to complete this lab. It was interesting to see that the smallest integer or Largest integer be converted due to user input. Overall, an effective lab to show my progress. 

* Lab 7:
Lab 7 was a tricky lab as we had to implement a code that dictates if a car is able to park in a specific spot. Had to use various different if and else if statements, as well as implementing the booleans. As well as writing in specific hours and minutes in order to make sure that a person can and cannot park. Overall, it was fun trying to solve this lab.

* Lab 9 Part 1:
Lab 9 was another tricky lab that I enjoyed. Mainly due to the fact that we had to start using text files and making sure that each word was spelled correct. It was a different experience in a sense, because we mainly used numbers to complete the labs not words. So using text files was an interesting lab, implementing push back and to see if the word matches with the text or not. Productive lab as we had to learn how to implement other files such as the txt files.
